The actual dart file used in build_runner is generated in example/.dart_tool/build/entrypoint/build.dart

Use it in order to attach debug session.

```json
{
    "name": "builder",
    "request": "launch",
    "type": "dart",
    "program": "example/.dart_tool/build/entrypoint/build.dart",
    "args": [
        "build"
    ]
}
```

If it doesn't exist, run
```bash
dart run build_runner build
```
to generate.
